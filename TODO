TODO

General
=======
* Fix all FIXMEs in the source. 


nfs4st.py
=========
* Split nfs4st.py into several files, one for each test suite. 

* Make it possible to use nfs4st with servers not supporting special
devices, like block devices. Need support in test_tree_net for this as
well. 

* More boundary-tests, like SETATTR(size) with too short and too long
buffers. 

* Choice of TCP/UDP: Should work the same way as with nfs4client,
eg. TCP is first tried, then UDP? In that case, the transport should
be saved, so we do not need to try TCP on every test case. Use
nfs4lib.create_client, just as nfs4client. 

* Better infrastructure for skipping tests that cannot be executed,
for some reason. Use SkipException more. 

* More RENAME tests. 

* More tests on invalid attributes. 

* Test all missing operations. 

* More testing of stale filehandles. 

* Checking, all the time, if the returned error code is valid for the
operation.

Hard to do, but anyway:

* Verify that filehandles are never reused. 


nfs4client.py
============
* Test more. 

* Support for NFS4ERR_FHEXPIRED and volatile filehandles. 

* Named attributes. 

* Handle server reboots. (Note to self: When a new verifier is
created, the sequence counter should be reset.)

* Increase performance by sending & receiving multiple packets at a
time, eg. send, send, ..., select, recv, recv, ..., send, send, ...)
rather than select, recv, send,, recv, send, etc. Or, rewrite the
Python XDR and RPC modules in C :-)
