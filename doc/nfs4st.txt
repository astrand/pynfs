Various notes for the NFS4 server test suite (nfs4st.py)
========================================================

* It's not possible to test NFS4ERR_BADHANDLE, since there is no way
of knowing the servers internal representation.

* With servers supporting files named "." and "..", several additional
  tests could be made. No such tests are currently done, because I
  have no such server. Probably no existing server supports "." or
  ".." as file names.
