Various, unsorted notes for the NFS4 server test suite (nfs4st.py)
==================================================================

* It's not possible to test NFS4ERR_BADHANDLE, since there is no way
  of knowing the servers internal representation.

* With servers supporting files named "." and "..", several additional
  tests could be made. No such tests are currently done, because I
  have no such server. Probably no existing server supports "." or
  ".." as file names. 

* It's not possible to run two instances of nfs4st.py against the
  same test tree at the same time.
