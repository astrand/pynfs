Test tree creation
==================
Before the test suite nfs4st.py can run, a directory tree with content
must be created. test_tree_net.py does this job. It creates the tree
via NFSv4, over the network. It can optionally take a prefix. A
directory tree with different kinds of files will be created under
<prefix>/nfs4st/

After (successfully) running test_tree_net.py, you can run
nfs4st.py. You should use the same prefix. 

Example:

./test_tree_net.py myserver/testing
./nfs4st.py myserver/testing AccessSuite
