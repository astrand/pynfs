Test case documentation extracter
=================================
Each test suite and test case in nfs4st.py is documented with Python
docstrings in the source code. With epinfo2sxw.py, this information
can be extracted and converted into a StarOffice 6 document. The
tables in Appendix B in the report are generated in this way. The
program also warns about inconsistencies in test cases or test case
documentation.
