The NFSv4 library nfs4lib.py
============================
nfs4lib.py is the base platform for the client and test
suite. Although the RPC compiler automatically generates routines for
packing and unpacking of data types, some utility and convenience
methods are necessary. nfs4lib.py defines the classes UDPNFS4Client
and TCPNFS4Client, which deals with state like a current directory,
last sequence id etc. The class NFS4OpenFile is also implemented. It
is a Python file-like object which allows reading and writing files
via NFSv4 using the same methods as for regular, local files.

The functions for unpacking replies in nfs4lib.py always checks if
extra, unextracted data remains after unpacking returned data types as
specified by the protocol. This means that nfs4lib.py detects if
servers return too much data. Most C implementations do not do this.


Unsorted notes
--------------

* When it comes to filenames/paths, the library uses lists of
components. The only exceptions is NFS4OpenFile, which uses Unix
pathnames (currently) and get_pathcomps_rel.
