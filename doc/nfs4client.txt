The Python NFSv4 command line client
====================================
This command line client was developed mainly as a tool to simplify
development, to gain further understanding of the protocol and to test
nfs4lib.py. It builds upon nfs4lib.py and the Python standard library
module cmd.py, which provides a framework for building line-oriented
interpreters. An example session is given below:

[peter@maggie pynfs]$ ./nfs4client.py ford
nfs4: >cd doc
nfs4: /doc>ls
README
porting
nfs4: /doc>cat README
Welcome to this NFS4 server.
Enjoy.

nfs4: /doc>

One feature of this client is that it can run in a pythonmode. This
means that it acts as a normal Python interactive interpreter,
extended with NFS client commands. It can be used for constructing
NFSv4 requests manually, for example. The NFSv4 client instance is
accessible via the c.ncl reference. An example is given below:

[peter@maggie pynfs]$ ./nfs4client.py ford
nfs4: >pythonmode 
pythonmode is now on
nfs4: >putrootfhop = c.ncl.putrootfh_op()
nfs4: >lookupop = c.ncl.lookup_op("doc")
nfs4: >accessop = c.ncl.access_op(ACCESS4_READ)
nfs4: >res = c.ncl.compound([putrootfhop, lookupop, accessop])
nfs4: >res
<COMPOUND4res: status=0 tag= resarray=[<nfs_resop4: resop=24 opaccess=None opclose=N...>
nfs4: >res.resarray[2].arm
<ACCESS4res: status=0 resok4=<ACCESS4resok: supported=1 access=1>>
nfs4: >res.resarray[2].arm.arm
<ACCESS4resok: supported=1 access=1>
nfs4: >
