The RPC compiler rpcgen.py
==========================
Traditionally, RPC servers and clients are written in C. In this case,
a program called rpcgen is often used. It takes a protocol
specification in RPC language format and generates client and server
stubs for packing and unpacking of data. In this way, the application
programmer can call remote procedures nearly as easy as with local
procedures.

Since no such RPC protocol compiler existed1 for Python when we
started working on pynfs, we decided to write one. rpcgen.py generates
classes for all structures and unions. This makes it easy to treat
many NFSv4 data types as objects.

rpcgen.py uses a lexical scanner and parser called PLY [PLY], written
by David M. Beazley, University of Chicago. rpcgen.py is not very well
tested with other protocol specifications than NFSv4. It has known
deficiencies. For example, it does not handle a certain type of
recursive data structures. See the comments in the source code for
more information.
