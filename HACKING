Different path data types and variable names
============================================
pathname: An XDR array; pathname4. 
component: A string with a single object name. Example: "doc". 
unixpath: Example: "/dev/fd0"
pathcomps: A list of components. Example: ["doc", "README"]

The function nfs4lib.unixpath2comps translates a unixpath to pathcomps. 

Misc
====
"object" is preferred over "file", when talking about nfs_ftype4's. 


Test tree principle
===================
Initial tree content is created by test_tree.py. Test cases may create
additional objects, but should use the tmp directory. Test cases need
not to delete created objects; failed test cases are unable to do so
anyway. Instead, test cases creating objects should remove the object
in question before trying the creation. 


Test case preparation failure
=============================
If the preparation for a test case (such as creating a directory in
preparation for testing REMOVE) fails, the test case should be skipped
with a warning.
