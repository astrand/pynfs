Different path data types and variable names
============================================
pathname: An XDR array; pathname4. 
component: A string with a single object name. Example: "doc". 
unixpath: Example: "/dev/fd0"
pathcomps: A list of components. Example: ["doc", "README"]

The function nfs4lib.unixpath2comps translates a unixpath to pathcomps. 

Misc
====
"object" is preferred over "file", when talking about nfs_ftype4's. 


Test tree principle
===================
Initial tree content is created by test_tree_net.py. Earlier, the
script test_tree.py, which runs locally, was used. This method is not
used anymore, since it is not always possible to run an Python
interpreter locally. For example, NetApp Filers are only accessible
via the network.

Test cases may create additional objects, but should use the tmp
directory. Test cases need not to delete created objects; failed test
cases are unable to do so anyway. Instead, test cases creating objects
should remove the object in question before trying the creation.

The test suite uses uid=0 and gid=0 when testing. The reason for this
is that root privilegies is required to create special device files,
for example. If your server uses root_squashing, tests may fail. 


Test case preparation failure
=============================
If the preparation for a test case (such as creating a directory in
preparation for testing REMOVE) fails, the test case should be skipped
with a warning.
