This is an example of an imaginary PhoneFinger-service. The idea is to
have an service providing the phone number of a certain user on a
certain host. 

The remote procedure accepts an username and returns a boolean value
indicating if the call succeded or not, and an string with the phone
number. 

This demo code has hardcoded username, statuscode and phone number.
